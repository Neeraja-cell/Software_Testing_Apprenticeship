## What is Java?

Java is a strongly-typed, object-oriented, class-based, general-purpose programming language. It was created to address issues associated with other similar languages during the mid 90s.

The main focus was its object-oriented design. We'll explore object-oriented programming at a later date.

## Getting Started

Below is a *source code* snippet written in Java.

```java
// main class declaration
public class Main {
    // main method declaration
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // call to a print function
        // which will produce text on your terminal
        System.out.println("Hello from Java-land!");
    }
}
```

What's going on here? Take a look at the first line. Here we're declaring a class. Don't worry too much about this now, just know that classes are where all of our code will reside in Java.

Java as a platform is expecting to handle classes to generate what's known as *bytecode*. We'll touch more on this later!

Do you notice the curly braces? Those denote what's known as a *block*. These blocks will be important later once we touch on what's known as *scope*. For now, just know that code will be placed within these curly braces like so:


```java
